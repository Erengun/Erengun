## Yo ðŸ‘‹

I'm Eren, a passionate coder and **open-source enthusiast** with a love for building mobile and web apps. I received my Computer Science education at [Ecole 42](https://42.fr/en/what-is-42/42-program-explained/), which laid a strong foundation for my tech journey.

You'll find here some of my projects and packages that highlight my skills and interests, particularly within the Flutter ecosystem. Whether itâ€™s developing innovative solutions or contributing to the open-source community, Iâ€™m always excited to explore new technologies and collaborate on impactful projects.
