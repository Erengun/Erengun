## Yo 👋

I'm Eren, a passionate coder and **open-source enthusiast** with a love for building mobile and web apps. I received my Computer Science education at [Ecole 42](https://42.fr/en/what-is-42/42-program-explained/), which laid a strong foundation for my tech journey.

You'll find here some of my projects and packages that highlight my skills and interests, particularly within the Flutter ecosystem. Whether it’s developing innovative solutions or contributing to the open-source community, I’m always excited to explore new technologies and collaborate on impactful projects.
